Direct-Mapped Caches, Set associative Cache, Fully Associative Cache, N-Way Set associative Cache

# Overview
The Cache Simulator project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding and comparison of different cache mapping techniques, specifically focusing on Direct-Mapped Caches, Set Associative Caches, Fully Associative Caches, and N-Way Set Associative Caches. Caches play a crucial role in improving memory access times, and exploring their behavior under different scenarios is essential for computer architecture understanding.

Key Features:

Direct-Mapped Cache:

Simulates a direct-mapped cache, where each block in main memory corresponds to exactly one cache line.
Explores the simplicity and limitations associated with this mapping technique.
Analyzes cache hits, misses, and conflicts.
Set Associative Cache:

Implements a set-associative cache, allowing blocks from main memory to map to a specific set with multiple cache lines.
Examines the impact of increased associativity on cache performance.
Compares and contrasts results with the direct-mapped approach.
Fully Associative Cache:

Models a fully associative cache, where any block from main memory can map to any cache line.
Explores the flexibility and complexity associated with fully associative mapping.
Evaluates cache behavior under varying workloads.
N-Way Set Associative Cache:

Introduces the concept of N-way set associativity, combining benefits from both direct-mapped and fully associative caches.
Analyzes the impact of changing associativity levels (N) on cache performance.
Provides insights into trade-offs between flexibility and complexity.
